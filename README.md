**Overview:**
Welcome to our Data-Driven Neighborhood Evaluation Project! This repository documents our collaborative effort to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using a data-driven approach. Leveraging datasets from the WPRDC, we aim to create a compelling argument for the neighborhood that stands out as the best, based on a unique metric.
