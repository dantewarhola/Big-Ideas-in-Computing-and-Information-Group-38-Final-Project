To determine the best neighborhood, we looked at a multitude of different datasets, which gave us many ideas for what our metric could be. We originally started out with finding the highest rent-to-income ratio among neighborhoods, but eventually landed on the best neighborhood to own a dog in."

    "For our final project we found the best city to own a dog in. To do this, we used the metrics of the number of parks, amount of traffic, and number of smart trash containers a neighborhood has. We decided on these metrics as parks are a great place to walk a dog, lots of traffic is unsafe for dogs, and trash containers are needed while walking a dog. With these three metrics combined we were able to figure out what the best niehgborhood to own a dog in is. Below are links of the datasets used in our investigation.\n",
